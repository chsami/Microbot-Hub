## Requirements
- Microbot RuneLite client
- Plugin enabled in the Microbot plugin list

## How It Works
1. Change the settings to your liking food amount, casting shadow veil, etc.
2. Go to the NPC you want to steal from and either select it in the dropdown list from "NPC to Thieve" or mark it using the NPC Indicator plugin.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Enjoy.

---

## Limitations
- The Plugin will always steal from a marked NPC before stealing from a NPC from the list. If you want to use the "NPC to Thieve" function unmark all other NPCs in the area.
