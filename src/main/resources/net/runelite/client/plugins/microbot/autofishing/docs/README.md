## How It Works

1. Configure your desired fishing method and options
2. Equip the appropriate fishing equipment
3. Have necessary bait in your inventory (if required)
4. Position yourself near fishing spots
5. Start the plugin
6. The plugin will:
   - Find appropriate fishing spots
   - Fish until inventory is full
   - Bank fish if banking is enabled
   - Use special attacks with harpoons when available
   - Return to fishing spots and repeat

## Special Attack Integration

When using harpoons (Dragon harpoon, Infernal harpoon, etc.), the plugin will:
- Monitor special attack energy
- Automatically use special attacks at 100% energy
- Maximize fishing speed and experience rates

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No fishing spots found**: Ensure you're in an area with active fishing spots
- **Wrong equipment**: Check that you have the correct fishing equipment for your selected method
- **No bait**: Some fishing methods require bait - ensure you have the appropriate type
- **Banking issues**: Make sure banking is properly configured and you're near a bank

## Limitations

- Must be in areas with accessible fishing spots
- Banking requires proximity to supported banks
- Some fishing spots may be crowded with other players
- Weather and game updates may affect fishing spot availability
