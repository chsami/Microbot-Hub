## Requirements
- Microbot RuneLite client
- Plugin enabled in the Microbot plugin list
- Required Levels and Runes for the Mage Training Arena Minigames

---

## How It Works
1. Change the settings to your liking.
2. Configure staves and tomes, make sure you can equip them.
3. Staves, Tomes, Laws, Cosmic and Nature runes in inventory only, currently no rune pouch support!
4. T6 enchant requires Lava staff OR Tome of Fire and any Earth staff.
5. T5 enchant requires Tome of Water and any Earth staff, OR either water/earth runes.
6. When set to buy rewards, the rooms are cycled until the points are met, the reward will be stored in your bank.
7. If not set to buy rewards, the rooms are cycled as if it would buy the rewards then continues cycling the rooms afterwards.
8. The 'All items' reward option will get enough points for you to finish the Collection Log.
9. For repeat rooms functionality to work the requirements must be met and you must be in the room you wish to repeat.
10. Enjoy! :)
