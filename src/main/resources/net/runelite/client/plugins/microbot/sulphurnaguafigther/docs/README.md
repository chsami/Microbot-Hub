Sulphur Nagua Fighter

This plugin is an Old School RuneScape script that automates fighting Sulphur Naguas in the Cam Torum region of Varlamore. It handles combat, potion management to let you train combat skills efficiently.

## Features

* **Automated Combat**: The script automatically attacks Sulphur Naguas in the designated combat area.
* **Potion Management**: The bot drinks Moonlight potions when your prayer points are low and crafts new ones from grubs and vials of water. It can even drop some potions temporarily to make space for ingredients and then pick them up later.
* **Banking and Resupply**: The bot uses a nearby bank to get supplies, including a pestle and mortar. You can also configure it to use a specific inventory setup for banking.
* **Pathing**: The bot handles walking between the combat area, the preparation area, and the bank.
* **Anti-Ban Support**: The plugin uses Microbot's anti-ban system to mimic human-like behavior, with features like natural mouse movements and non-linear action intervals.
* **Overlay**: An on-screen overlay shows real-time stats like the current state of the script, total kills, and XP gained per hour.

## Requirements

* **Access to Varlamore**: You must have access to Varlamore and the Cam Torum area.
* **Perilous Moons Quest**: Completion of the 'Perilous Moons' quest is required.
* **Minimum Skills**: You need at least 43 Prayer and 38 Herblore.
* **Pestle and Mortar**: The script needs a pestle and mortar to make potions.

## Configuration

* `Use Inventory Setup?`: Enable this to use a custom inventory setup for banking.
* `Inventory Setup`: Select the specific inventory setup to use.
