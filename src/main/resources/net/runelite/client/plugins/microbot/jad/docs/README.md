# Jad Plugin

The Jad Plugin for Microbot is designed to assist players during the TzTok-Jad boss fight in the Fight Caves. Its primary purpose is to help with the prayer switching mechanic, the key challenge of this encounter.


## Functionality

### Animation Detection
The plugin monitors Jadâ€™s attack animations. Based on whether Jad is casting Magic or Ranged, the plugin determines which protection prayer the player should use.
