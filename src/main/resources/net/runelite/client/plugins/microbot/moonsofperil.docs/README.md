## Script Sequence
1. Start inside Neypotzli
2. Auto-stocks food and potions
3. Boss order: Eclipse → Blue → Blood (optimal GP/hr)
4. Claim rewards chest, then repeat

## Boss Notes
- Ideally a full normal attack sequence can run without the need to eat or drink. This drastically increases DPS
- **Eclipse Moon:** use your best **stab** weapon.
  - Clone phase = burst DPS with your highest-hit 2-handed weapon. 
  - If you spawn into the boss arena mid-shield special attack, the script exits the arena and re-enters.
- **Blue Moon:** use your best **crush** weapon. 
  - The plugin ignores the tornadoes special attack; ~100 HP heal is negligible compared to hitpoint impact of tornadoes
- **Blood Moon:** use your best slash weapon
  - high defense & tank gear helps to block the boss healing, which improves boss completion times.
  - maximise your normal attack sequence DPS for best results

## FAQ
How do I get the plugin?
- The plugin is on the main Microbot release.

The script sits on “Idle”. What now?
- Verify you selected an InventorySetup after any edits (switch to another preset, then back).
- Degraded gear users (eg Barrows, Moons): enable Fuzzy matching so degraded armour is recognised.
- If it still idles, create a brand-new inventory setup and re-select it.

## How do I report a bug?
- Enable Debug Logs in the plugin configuration, record a clip or video, and post it in the discord Bug Reports channel, following the Microbot template for Bug Reporting.
