# Ourania (ZMI) Runecrafting Plugin

This plugin automates runecrafting at the Ourania Altar (ZMI)

## Features
- Supports both Pure and Regular Essence
- Multiple pathing options to the altar
- Optional direct interaction with the altar (requires GPU plugin)
- Deposit All support (with inventory slot locking)
- Mass world hopping
- Automatic food and energy potion usage
- Overlay and profit calculator toggles

## Requirements
- **Auto-pay runes** must be configured with Eniola (the banker at ZMI)
- **Lunar Spellbook** is required
- You must have spoken to **Baby Yaga** to unlock the Ourania Teleport spell
- **Runepouch** with runes for Ourania Teleport and payment runes (recommended: Dust Battlestaff or Staff of Earth)
- If using Deposit All, **lock the inventory slots** for items you want to keep (e.g., runepouch, essence pouches)

## Setup
1. Install and enable the plugin in your client.
2. Configure your inventory and equipment, ensuring you have:
   - Runepouch with required runes
   - Payment runes for Eniola
   - Teleport staff (Dust Battlestaff or Staff of Earth recommended)
   - Food and/or energy potions if desired
3. Adjust plugin settings to match your preferences (essence type, path, deposit all, etc).

## Usage Tips
- The plugin will eat food and drink energy potions at the bank if configured.
- For best results, use the deposit all feature with inventory slot locking to avoid losing important items.
- Overlay and profit calculator can be toggled in the settings.

## Troubleshooting
- If the plugin is not teleporting, check your runepouch and staff setup.
- If you are missing runes for payment or teleport, the plugin may not function correctly.
- For pathing issues, try switching between the available path options.
